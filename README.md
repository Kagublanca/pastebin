 # PasteBin Clone

This is just a little project I made to try out EJS, and complile a fullstack application with Mongodb. I rather like how it turned out in the end.

------------

### What is it?

PasteBin is a way to share and post code with people through the internet in a clean way, with no hassle. It will automatically detect what code has been posted, thus highlighting it correctly.

------------



### How to use

Extremely simple, click the "New" button towards the right of the screen. You will be directed to /new, from here you can paste (or type if you like a challenge) code into the text field. After you have finished, click the now present "Save" button to generate a unique url which you can share with anybody to see your code!

------------



### Known Bugs

So far, the only bug is when you save a file with plain text. The program will still try and detect a language, which will make your text look all funky with crazy colours (why did I put this under bugs and not features???).

------------



### What next?

Known functionality to add is a "Copy" button after you have saved the document. So that you can copy the current saved document if you wish to add more to it at after the fact.
